# EzDrive: An iOS platform for car-sharing

This repo holds the source code for a project completed for NUS Orbital Program held during the summer of 2018.
Embarassingly, there are no commits for this project because at the time of creating this application, I was not yet 
familiar with source control and thus did not use it for this project. However, for the purpose of displaying the 
past projects that I have completed and to show the type of code I have written, I decided to put this on GitHub.

## Introduction

EzDrive is an iOS application that aims to provide an easy and simple to use car-sharing platform for car owners in Singapore. 
We found that there are many car owners in Singapore, yet not fully utilising the car at times. With cars being notoriously 
expensive here, there are also many drivers that do not personally own cars. This application was created with the idea of 
connecting these two groups of people to allow car sharing to take place.

There are two main user types in this application, namely car owners and car renters. Car owners can post their cars on the 
app when they wish to rent it out, specifying their car type and model, period of loan, photos of the car and some other 
general information. Car renters can easily browse through available cars on the application, select whichever one they are 
interested in renting and the exchange can happen entirely on the application. 

## Information

This project was built entirely in Swift 4.0. The UI was built 100% programmatically, with no storyboards or interface 
builder.

Backend used is Firebase Database and no other third-party libraries were used.
